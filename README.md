# Self Learning
Here we're trying to implement, check, or examine some theories, suggestions or software tools (libs). All by ourselves, this code is not from some courses teaching materials.<br>
Well Ok, there's no 'we', all of those are my one's, but I will follow the scientific\educational works' approach when all the actions of implementer(s) are described in plural form.

## List of issues explored

| Program's name | Description | Used libs | 
| :--------: | :------------| :---------------------- |
| [kNearestNeighbors realization](knn_implementation)| k-NearestNeighbors (KNN) is one of the easiest to understand ML-algorithms. But could we implement this thing based on theory from scratch?| *pandas, numpy, matplotlib*|
| [ROC curve and ROC-AUC](roc_and_roc_auc) | We will calculate data for Receiver Operating Characteristics curve, then plot it and then we'll try to calculate area under that curve.| *pandas, numpy, matplotlib, sklearn*|
| [Most frequent number (not algo)](most_frequent_number_not_algo) | We're going to explore several methods of finding the most frequent element in a set - quite a common task. The goal is to determine, which one actually works fastest. Don't be confused, this is <u> not an algorithm task </u> for finding most frequent object| *pandas, numpy* |
